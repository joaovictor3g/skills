# Test Writer

Create high-value tests with clear intent.

## Workflow

1. Identify critical behavior, boundaries, and failure modes.
2. Choose the right test level: unit, integration, or end-to-end.
3. Write deterministic tests with explicit setup and assertions.
4. Avoid over-mocking; prefer realistic seams and stable fixtures.
5. Cover success, edge, and error paths for changed behavior.
6. Run tests and remove flakiness before finalizing.

## Output

- Tests mapped to behavior.
- Coverage of changed logic and edge cases.
- Notes on known gaps and next test priorities.

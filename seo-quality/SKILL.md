# SEO Quality

Improve SEO with verifiable, high-impact changes.

## Workflow

1. Audit current SEO state: indexability, crawlability, metadata, headings, links, and performance.
2. Prioritize issues by impact on discoverability and user intent coverage.
3. Implement technical fixes first: robots, canonical, sitemap, redirects, status codes, and duplicate-content controls.
4. Improve on-page signals: title tags, meta descriptions, heading hierarchy, semantic content, and internal links.
5. Add or fix structured data relevant to page type using valid schema markup.
6. Verify outcomes with measurable checks and document remaining risks.

## Checklist

- Unique, intent-aligned title and meta description for each indexable page.
- One clear H1 per page and logical heading hierarchy.
- Canonical tags and index directives are correct.
- XML sitemap is current and robots rules do not block critical pages.
- Internal links support crawl depth and topical relevance.
- Core web vitals and loading performance are acceptable.
- Structured data validates and matches visible content.

## Guardrails

- Focus on sustainable SEO best practices, not manipulative tactics.
- Do not promise guaranteed rankings; report measurable readiness and risk reduction.
- Keep recommendations tied to user intent and content quality.

## Output

- SEO issues found and priority order.
- Implemented fixes and rationale.
- Verification results and unresolved risks.
- Next iteration plan for continuous SEO improvement.

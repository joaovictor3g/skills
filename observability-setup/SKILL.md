# Observability Setup

Instrument systems for fast diagnosis and response.

## Workflow

1. Identify critical user journeys and service-level objectives.
2. Add structured logs with correlation identifiers.
3. Add metrics for throughput, latency, errors, and saturation.
4. Add distributed tracing across service boundaries.
5. Configure actionable alerts with clear runbook links.
6. Validate signal quality with failure simulations.

## Output

- Telemetry instrumentation changes.
- Dashboards and alert definitions.
- Validation results and known blind spots.

# API Contracts

Keep interfaces explicit and stable.

## Workflow

1. Define request, response, error, and pagination formats.
2. Specify field constraints, nullability, defaults, and examples.
3. Validate backward and forward compatibility before changes.
4. Align server validation, documentation, and client types.
5. Add automated contract checks or schema tests.
6. Document deprecations and migration paths for consumers.

## Output

- Contract specification.
- Compatibility assessment.
- Implementation and test updates.
- Consumer migration guidance.

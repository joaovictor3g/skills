description: Diagnose and optimize runtime performance with measurements. Use when apps feel slow, queries are expensive, latency rises, throughput drops, memory grows, or teams need evidence-based optimization decisions.

# Performance Profiler

Measure first, optimize second.

## Workflow

1. Define performance goals and user-facing bottlenecks.
2. Capture baseline metrics with reproducible scenarios.
3. Locate hot paths using profiling and timing instrumentation.
4. Apply targeted optimizations with clear tradeoff notes.
5. Re-measure after each change to confirm improvement.
6. Document wins, regressions, and next optimization targets.

## Output

- Baseline and post-change metrics.
- Root bottlenecks identified.
- Verified optimizations with impact.

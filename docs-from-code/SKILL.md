# Docs From Code

Write docs from source-of-truth behavior.

## Workflow

1. Read implementation and extract current behavior and contracts.
2. Document purpose, inputs, outputs, side effects, and failure modes.
3. Include setup, operation, and troubleshooting steps when relevant.
4. Mark assumptions and unknowns instead of inventing details.
5. Keep examples executable and aligned with current code.
6. Update docs whenever behavior or interfaces change.

## Output

- Accurate documentation sections.
- References to concrete code paths.
- Open questions where code is ambiguous.

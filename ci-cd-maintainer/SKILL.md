# CI CD Maintainer

Keep pipelines fast, stable, and trustworthy.

## Workflow

1. Map current pipeline stages, dependencies, and bottlenecks.
2. Remove flaky steps and make failures actionable.
3. Optimize caching, parallelism, and selective execution.
4. Enforce meaningful quality gates for merge and release.
5. Add artifacts and logs needed for fast diagnosis.
6. Track success rate, duration, and failure trends.

## Output

- Pipeline improvements.
- Reliability and speed deltas.
- Recommended next optimizations.

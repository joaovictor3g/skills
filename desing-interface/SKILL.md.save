# Desing Interface

Build UI-only solutions.

## Scope

- Implement pages, sections, and reusable visual components.
- Implement styling, spacing, typography, color systems, and visual hierarchy.
- Implement responsive behavior for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Implement UI states like loading, empty, error, hover, focus, and disabled.
- Avoid backend work, data modeling, API integration, authentication, and server logic.

## Workflow

1. Clarify the interface goal, target users, and primary screen flows.
2. Define a visual direction that matches the existing design system when present.
3. Build semantic, accessible markup and keyboard-friendly interactions.
4. Use mock or local static data when content is needed for presentation.
5. Verify responsiveness and interaction states before handoff.

## Output Standard

- Deliver production-ready UI code for the requested scope.
- Keep implementation modular and easy to extend.
- Document any intentional placeholders where backend integration is expected later.

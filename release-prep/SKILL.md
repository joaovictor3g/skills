# Release Prep

Ship with explicit gates and rollback readiness.

## Workflow

1. Freeze scope and confirm included changes.
2. Run release checks: tests, lint, build, migrations, smoke paths.
3. Verify observability and alerting for changed surfaces.
4. Draft release notes focused on user and operator impact.
5. Define rollout, monitoring, and rollback procedures.
6. Record post-release validation checklist.

## Output

- Release checklist status.
- Notes and known risks.
- Rollout and rollback plan.

# UX UI

Improve interface quality with user-centered changes.

## Workflow

1. Audit the current experience for usability, clarity, and visual consistency issues.
2. Prioritize improvements by user impact, severity, and implementation effort.
3. Define concrete UI and interaction changes before implementation.
4. Implement changes using the existing design system and component patterns.
5. Verify responsiveness, keyboard navigation, and accessibility states.
6. Summarize what improved and what remains for future iterations.

## Guardrails

- Keep changes focused on UX and UI concerns.
- Avoid backend, API, database, or business-logic changes unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve product behavior while reducing friction and confusion.

## Output

- UX and UI issues found.
- Prioritized improvement plan.
- Implemented interface updates.
- Validation notes for responsiveness and accessibility.

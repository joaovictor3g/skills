# Security Hardening

Reduce exploitable risk pragmatically.

## Workflow

1. Identify assets, trust boundaries, and likely attack paths.
2. Verify authentication, authorization, and session controls.
3. Enforce strict input validation and output encoding.
4. Check secret management and sensitive data exposure.
5. Review dependencies and configuration for known weaknesses.
6. Prioritize fixes by exploitability and business impact.

## Output

- Security findings with severity.
- Concrete remediations and safe defaults.
- Verification steps for each applied fix.
